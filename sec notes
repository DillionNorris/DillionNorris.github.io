                    ----- Basics -----
Asset:
somthing you would like to protect e.i passwords, info, phisical.

Attack:
attempt to compromise an asset
ex. vunariblility, theft

threat:
potential occurence that would have an undesiered output

vulnerability:
makes a threat possible

risk:
messure of thret possibility and damage severity

    threat details

threat vector:
Method used to cary out attack

                ----risk mannagment----

avoidance :
Stop risky behaior

acceptance :
risk is inevitable

mitigation:
have a prosses to recover from risk i.e insurance

deterrance:
make thr risk harder to exploit

transferance:
assign the cost to another entity i.e inssurance

map:
Track all assets

monitor:
know what is happening with your assets.

mitigate :
use automation to block and remove threats

manage:
revisit plan and refine.

        --- common risk types----

* phishing detection
* brand protection
* fraud protextion
* data monitoring
* leaked credentials
* malicous mobile apps
* supply chain risks

--- types of attacks----

interuption :
    an asset is destroyed or unusable

interception:
    man in the middle or evesdroping

modification
    Unauthorized tampering with asset

fabrication:
    counterfiting

----


---- methods of defense -----

* block attacj
* make attack harder/ deter
* deflect
*detect
*tollerance
*recover

 CIA triad:

 confidentioality :
 disclosure of information

 integrity:
 modification of info

 Avalibility
    denial of access to services

 - other principals

 authentisity
    varify sender
    verify content

accountability
    trance back to responcible party i.e github blame

obscurity
    hide details
    -------------------------------------------------
AAA triad : Authentication , Authorisation(permissions), Accounting (tracking actions)


Authentication
    username-passwords
    twofactor auth
    biometrics

---------

hardware
    workstation : pc
    server :centeral place for data and all
    backup: copy of essentioal data
    patch : update to address a vunariblility
    feature: targeting functionality over vulnerability
    service pack : patch + feature

access controll
    account:granted access to a machine

access control matrix

    user | os | program | data | insurance | payroll|
--------------------------------------------------------
    bob | rx  | rx      | r    | rw        | rw    |
---------------------------------------------------------
    sam | rwx| rwx      |r      |rw         |rw     |
--------------------------------------------------------
    r = read
    w = write
    x = exicute
--------------------------------------------------------


roll based access

    role : sudent
    would not have admin cappiblilitys

-----------------------
 machine virtualisation :

    pretty much just virtual box

    emulators

    streaming i.e stadia
--------------------
secure a workstation

    apply os patches
    apply application updates
    restrict ability to insall apps
    restrict ability to alter configs
    install anti viris
    enable local firewall
    strong passwords

secure server

    enable logging
    check logs regularly
    create regular backups
    shut down unneeded services / apps
    disable default accounts
------------------

kernal
    preforms lowest level functions
    interupt handling
    interprossess communications
    syncronisation
security kernal
    enforcing security mechanisms

    reffrence monitor :
        part of security kernal
        tampper proof *
        unbypassable
        analisable - testable

how to scan pc
    scanning for known vunariblilitys
    port scanning
    penetration testing
